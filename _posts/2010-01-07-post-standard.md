![Map]([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_portrait.jpg])

## Introduction: Who Was Frank Lloyd Wright?

- **Lifespan**: 1867–1959  
- **Profession**: Architect, interior designer, writer, and educator  
- **Birthplace**: Richland Center, Wisconsin  
- **Philosophy**: Developed the concept of *organic architecture* — promoting harmony between humanity and the environment.

Wright revolutionized American architecture by rejecting European styles and emphasizing simplicity, natural forms, and connection to nature.

## Career Highlights

- **Early Career**: Worked in Chicago under Louis Sullivan, a pioneer of skyscraper design, who famously said, *"form follows function."*  
- **Independent Practice**: Wright broke away from historicism, forging a distinctly American architectural language.  
- **Design Focus**: Advocated for buildings that were functional, integrated with their environment, and tailored to the people inhabiting them.

##  Architectural Style: Prairie and Organic Architecture

### Prairie Style

Wright’s Prairie Style emerged in the early 20th century and was marked by:

- Low-pitched roofs with wide, overhanging eaves  
- Strong horizontal lines reflecting the flat Midwestern landscape  
- Open, flowing interior spaces  
- Use of natural materials like stone and wood  
- Integration with the surrounding environment  

Prairie Style was Wright’s answer to ornate Victorian architecture, favoring a minimalist aesthetic rooted in harmony and function.  


### Organic Architecture

Wright expanded his vision through the philosophy of *organic architecture*, which sought to:

- Blend structures with their natural surroundings  
- Use local materials reflective of the environment  
- Embrace fluid, nature-inspired forms  
- Enhance the relationship between the building and its occupants  

This philosophy would define Wright’s later work and influence generations of architects.
