- Before elevators, buildings were **limited to six stories**.
- **Wealthy people lived on lower floors**, while the poor climbed stairs to upper floors.
- **After elevators:** The **rich moved to penthouses**, pushing the poor downward.

## **2. Skyscrapers Became Possible**
- Elevators were **blamed for rising crime rates**—thieves could escape quickly.
- Some believed they caused **"brain fever"** due to motion.

---

- Similar fears arose with **trains (1800s)** and **VR (today)**.

### **Elevator Control**
- Originally required **human operators**.
- Transition to **self-service elevators** met resistance—echoing **modern concerns about automation**.

## **Elevator Sickness: Real or Imagined?**

### **Motion Sickness in Early Elevators**
- The abrupt stop caused **bodies to keep moving slightly**, leading to disorientation.
- Suggested solution: **Pressing against the wall** to stabilize oneself.

### **Scientific Perspective**
- **Higher floors experience more motion**, causing sway sickness.
- Documented in **medical literature** as a modern equivalent of early elevator sickness.

### **Psychological Influence**
- **Fear-mongering in media** can induce symptoms.
- Example: **If someone mentions fleas, others start scratching!**

## **Labor Strikes & the Problem of Elevator Control**

### **Operator Strikes**
- **1943 Rockefeller Center strike:** Stranded **28,000 people**.
- Offices **shut down**, workers had to **walk dozens of flights**.

### **Push-Button Elevators: The Dawn of Automation**
- Eliminated the need for **operators**.
- **Resistance:** Some cities **banned automated elevators**.

## **Public Fear and the Push for Automation**

### **Why People Feared Automatic Elevators**
- **No windows, closed space, little sensation of movement.**
- **Lack of trust**—people felt safer with a human operator present.
